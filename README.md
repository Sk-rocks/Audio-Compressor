# Audio-Compressor

Compression of audio signals is of important significance in todayâ€™s world due to
limited bandwidth and transmission or storage capacity. Signal compression is a process
of compressing a speech signal into efficient encoded representations that can be
decoded to produce a signal that is as close to the original one.

MATLAB is one of the most used software to analyse and process a signal, This
project is based on the Matlab code to compress and analyse an audio signal using
Fourier transform.

Audio is the most important medium to be transmitted in a conference-like
application. In order to be able to successfully transmit audio through a low
bandwidth network, however, one needs to compress it, so that its required bandwidth
is manageable.

The primary goal of audio compression is to reduce the bit rate required to
represent an audio signal, thereby minimising storage space and transmission
bandwidth without significantly degrading perceived audio quality. This is achieved by
exploiting redundancies and irrelevancies present in the audio signal, both in the time
domain and the frequency domain.
